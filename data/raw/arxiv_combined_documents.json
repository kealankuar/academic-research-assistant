The great success of deep learning shows that its technology contains\nprofound truth, and understanding its internal mechanism not only has important\nimplications for the development of its technology and effective application in\nvarious fields, but also provides meaningful insights into the understanding of\nhuman brain mechanism. At present, most of the theoretical research on deep\nlearning is based on mathematics. This dissertation proposes that the neural\nnetwork of deep learning is a physical system, examines deep learning from\nthree different perspectives: microscopic, macroscopic, and physical world\nviews, answers multiple theoretical puzzles in deep learning by using physics\nprinciples. For example, from the perspective of quantum mechanics and\nstatistical physics, this dissertation presents the calculation methods for\nconvolution calculation, pooling, normalization, and Restricted Boltzmann\nMachine, as well as the selection of cost functions, explains why deep learning\nmust be deep, what characteristics are learned in deep learning, why\nConvolutional Neural Networks do not have to be trained layer by layer, and the\nlimitations of deep learning, etc., and proposes the theoretical direction and\nbasis for the further development of deep learning now and in the future.

The expressivity focuses on finding functions expressible by\ndeep nets but cannot be approximated by shallow nets with the similar number of\nneurons. It usually implies the large capacity. The generalization aims at\nderiving fast learning rate for deep nets. It usually requires small capacity\nto reduce the variance. Different from previous studies on deep learning,\npursuing either expressivity or generalization, we take both factors into\naccount to explore the theoretical advantages of deep nets. For this purpose,\nwe construct a deep net with two hidden layers possessing excellent\nexpressivity in terms of localized and sparse approximation. Then, utilizing\nthe well known covering number to measure the capacity, we find that deep nets\npossess excellent expressive power (measured by localized and sparse\napproximation) without enlarging the capacity of shallow nets. As a\nconsequence, we derive near optimal learning rates for implementing empirical\nrisk minimization (ERM) on the constructed deep nets.

In\nthis work, we utilize the Fourier analysis to empirically provide a promising\nmechanism to understand why feedforward deeper learning is faster. To this end,\nwe separate a deep neural network, trained by normal stochastic gradient\ndescent, into two parts during analysis, i.e., a pre-condition component and a\nlearning component, in which the output of the pre-condition one is the input\nof the learning one. We use a filtering method to characterize the frequency\ndistribution of a high-dimensional function. Based on experiments of deep\nnetworks and real dataset, we propose a deep frequency principle, that is, the\neffective target function for a deeper hidden layer biases towards lower\nfrequency during the training. Therefore, the learning component effectively\nlearns a lower frequency function if the pre-condition component has more\nlayers. Due to the well-studied frequency principle, i.e., deep neural networks\nlearn lower frequency functions faster, the deep frequency principle provides a\nreasonable explanation to why deeper learning is faster.

However, one of the big challenges of this approach is that neural\nnetworks have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. This means\nthat, unless they are designed properly, they are not an ideal candidate for\ncontrollers due to issues with robustness and uncertainty, which are pivotal\naspects of control systems. There has been initial work on robustness to both\nanalyse and design dynamical systems with neural network controllers.

These structures\nmay not be appropriate for neural network controllers and it is important to\nconsider alternative architectures. This paper considers rational neural\nnetworks and presents novel rational activation functions, which can be used\neffectively in robustness problems for neural feedback loops. Rational\nactivation functions are replaced by a general rational neural network\nstructure, which is convex in the neural network's parameters.

However, there areno\ntheoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks\nencountered inpractice. This paper solves this fundamental problem by\ninvestigating such overparameterizeddeep neural networks when fully trained. We\ngeneralize a new technique called neural feature repopulation, originally\nintroduced in (Fang et al., 2019a) for two-level neural networks, to analyze\ndeep neural networks. It is shown that under suitable representations,\noverparameterized deep neural networks are inherently convex, and when\noptimized, the system can learn effective features suitable for the underlying\nlearning task under mild conditions. This new analysis is consistent with\nempirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning\nefficient feature representations. Therefore, the highly unexpected result of\nthis paper can satisfactorily explain the practical success of deep neural\nnetworks. Empirical studies confirm that predictions of our theory are\nconsistent with results observed in practice.",

This method automatically trains the functionality of\nany sequence of real physical systems, directly, using backpropagation, the\nsame technique used for modern deep neural networks. To illustrate their\ngenerality, we demonstrate physical neural networks with three diverse physical\nsystems-optical, mechanical, and electrical. Physical neural networks may\nfacilitate unconventional machine learning hardware that is orders of magnitude\nfaster and more energy efficient than conventional electronic processors.",

    "text": "Understanding Weight Similarity of Neural Networks via Chain\n  Normalization Rule and Hypothesis-Training-Testing. We present a weight similarity measure method that can quantify the weight\nsimilarity of non-convex neural networks. To understand the weight similarity\nof different trained models, we propose to extract the feature representation\nfrom the weights of neural networks. We first normalize the weights of neural\nnetworks by introducing a chain normalization rule, which is used for weight\nrepresentation learning and weight similarity measure. We extend the\ntraditional hypothesis-testing method to a hypothesis-training-testing\nstatistical inference method to validate the hypothesis on the weight\nsimilarity of neural networks. With the chain normalization rule and the new\nstatistical inference, we study the weight similarity measure on Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN), and find that the weights of an identical neural network\noptimized with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm converge to a\nsimilar local solution in a metric space. The weight similarity measure\nprovides more insight into the local solutions of neural networks. Experiments\non several datasets consistently validate the hypothesis of weight similarity\nmeasure.",

    "text": "Consistency of Neural Networks with Regularization. Neural networks have attracted a lot of attention due to its success in\napplications such as natural language processing and computer vision. For large\nscale data, due to the tremendous number of parameters in neural networks,\noverfitting is an issue in training neural networks. To avoid overfitting, one\ncommon approach is to penalize the parameters especially the weights in neural\nnetworks. Although neural networks has demonstrated its advantages in many\napplications, the theoretical foundation of penalized neural networks has not\nbeen well-established. Our goal of this paper is to propose the general\nframework of neural networks with regularization and prove its consistency.\nUnder certain conditions, the estimated neural network will converge to true\nunderlying function as the sample size increases. The method of sieves and the\ntheory on minimal neural networks are used to overcome the issue of\nunidentifiability for the parameters. Two types of activation functions:\nhyperbolic tangent function(Tanh) and rectified linear unit(ReLU) have been\ntaken into consideration. Simulations have been conducted to verify the\nvalidation of theorem of consistency.",

    "text": "Graph Metanetworks for Processing Diverse Neural Architectures. Neural networks efficiently encode learned information within their\nparameters. Consequently, many tasks can be unified by treating neural networks\nthemselves as input data. When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the\nimportance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces.\nHowever, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such\nas MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such\narchitectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we\novercome these challenges by building new metanetworks - neural networks that\ntake weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully\nbuild graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs\nusing graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs),\ngeneralizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as\nmulti-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet\nblocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive\nand equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural\nnetwork functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on\nseveral metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.",

A novel hybrid deep neural network architecture is designed to capture the\nspatial-temporal features of unsteady flows around moving boundaries directly\nfrom high-dimensional unsteady flow fields data.

Flow fields at future time step can be\npredicted through flow fields by previous time steps and boundary positions at\nthose steps by the novel hybrid deep neural network.
